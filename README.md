# docs
This repository contains all [full-stack-conversation](https://github.com/full-stack-conversations/docs/edit/master/README.md) Github organization documents. These documents are organized in the form of markdown based tutorials created and maintained by Vue and Vuepress. Note that the role of Vuepress is to facilitate a lot better MarkDown documents -  just being able to use **["Medium Zoom like"](https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom/tree/master/examples/react-markdown)** handling of images is quite sufficient to build the whole docs repository based on **[VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/)**.

Note that this repository contains the tutorials and other types of documents related to the content of the **[full-stack-conversations](https://github.com/full-stack-conversations/docs/edit/master/README.md)** organization. This relationship was choosen as the simpler technique than using [Monorepo](https://medium.com/@johnclarke_82232/mono-or-multi-repo-6c3674142dfc) approach.

The initially chosen topic is that of **[IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAM)** in the context of JavaScript full-stack applications - spefically full-stack applications where the back end application is based on [Strapi](https://strapi.io/). Our development plan keeps Strapi as the only invariant - we vary front-end frameworks of interest to many as well as IAM services that are implemented as a **[PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)**. Examples of such services include [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/), [Okta](https://www.okta.com/), etc. (see the [The 30 Best Identity Management Companies For 2020](https://solutionsreview.com/identity-management/the-30-best-identity-management-companies/) for more information.
